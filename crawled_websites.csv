No shortcuts, no cutting corners, no compromises – build it right. Learn More > Build it Right It’s not only what we do, it’s how we define our company. No shortcuts, no cutting corners, no compromises – build it right. Learn More > Your Trusted Partner Above and beyond the products and services we offer, our ultimate goal is to be your trusted business partner. A partner whose insights and contributions are viewed as key to your long-term success. Learn More > Embrace Challenge Whether it’s the technical challenges posed by a steeply sloped building site, an exposed architectural wall, or an extremely aggressive construction schedule, we push our capabilities to deliver quality concrete placement at every stage. Learn More > Excellence It’s not a skill, it’s an attitude. Our motivation to excel comes from our own satisfaction that our work has been done right, and not necessarily for others to notice. But it’s always nice when they do. Learn More > Residential: Custom Home Foundations We have helped many of Austin’s finest builders and most talented architects construct homes on sites that would make a mountain goat proud. Hill side projects pose serious constructability challenges, and every site is unique. That’s why formulating a build strategy with means and methods that are cost effective and executable is critical upfront. Whether your project is hill-side or lake-front, the geology of the home site – hydrology, soil type and proximity to veins of DelRio clay – are all factors that impact its constructability and engineering. Commercial Whether it’s a basic commercial foundation or a multi-story cast in place structure, we have the experience, the manpower, the equipment, and the bonding capacity to take on almost any sized project safely. Our foremen and crews have experienced most every facet of commercial construction including tilt-up, light commercial, and vertical structures of 2 to 10 stories. Our broad commercial experience is often the difference maker for a project staying on budget and on schedule in the critical early phases of construction. Civil Projects Our expertise in the civil market includes site preparation, retaining walls, tunnels, paving, curb, gutter and drainage features. Since 1992 our teams have worked a number of Austin’s complex civil projects such as the LBJ Presidential Library renovation and many others. In many cases our full-service approach allows us to provide a combined civil and structural solution – in a single turn-key bid. Multi-Family Our experience in the low to mid-rise multifamily market includes projects such as luxury condominiums, market-rate rental apartments, student housing, and military housing. Whether new construction or infill, we can provide a turn-key package that includes site preparation and all associated concrete work necessary to quickly transform your project into a revenue-generating asset. When it comes to multifamily residential projects, we understand that your utmost concerns are build schedule and budget. Markets We Serve As a recognized leader in the Central Texas market, we offer construction services to the residential, commercial, educational, municipal, state and federal government markets. Whether your project is a dream home or country ranch, a multi-family residence, a parking structure, a commercial office building, or an industrial warehouse; our experience enables us to accept projects of all sizes and scope. Austin Concrete Development is undoubtedly the leader in their field. They have successfully completed many complicated and highly detailed projects for my company these past two decades. Their attention to detail is unsurpassed; and they maintain a high safety level on their job sites, assuring that all OSHA safety standards are maintained. The company has my highest recommendation. Brian A. Bailey President Brian A. Bailey Homes Inc. Our firm provides structural engineering design services for a variety of projects in the Austin area and are typically involved with projects that are complicated structurally and are located on difficult sites. Challenges such as very steep grades,complex geometries and very expansive soils are common, and result in foundation designs that are often very complicated. Few concrete contractors have the expertise to construct these types of projects. Austin Concrete Development is definitely one of the best. We are always encouraged when we know that Rich and his team will be involved. We know with confidence the work will be executed in accordance with our designs and will be of the highest quality. Jeffrey L. Smith Principal Smith Structural Engineers I have worked with Rich for more than 15 years and have found him to be unfailingly good at what he does. I greatly respect his knowledge, experience and commitment to doing high-quality work. During the design phase he and his team are invaluable in helping the project team weigh options and arrive at efficient solutions for challenging sites. In construction, his team does an extraordinary job of understanding the drawings, raising questions and offering solutions to unexpected field conditions. Because of the expertise, and dependability of the entire team, I am always happy to see Austin Concrete Development on my projects. Dennis Duffy President Duffy Engineering Inc. “Austin Concrete Development has been a trusted part of my team for many years now. I’ve built a company with a reputation for Integrity and Excellence, and a big part of that has been my decade long partnership with Austin Concrete Development. I appreciate all that you do for us at Risinger Homes.” Matt Risinger President Risinger Homes “Austin Concrete Development has done a good job for us on the Landmark Conservancy apartment project. We appreciate you all working with us, and getting the project done in a timely manner, and we’d definitely like you to work for us in the future.” Eric Taylor Principal Oden Hughes / Multi-Family Development & Construction Connect with us: LinkedIn Facebook YouTube Contact Us ©2025 Austin Concrete Development | All Rights Reserved | Site by CreativePickle",http://www.ausconcrete.com/

Our prompt drivers and premium quality ready mix concrete products and services make us superior to our competition. Contact Us Advantages of Ready Mix Dallas TX Concrete used for construction projects is available either as ready-mix concrete or on-site mixing. Below is a quick comparison between the two to help you decide what’s best for your project needs. Ready Mix Concrete Ready mix concrete is delivered to the job site, ready to pour and use immediately No need to hire heavy machinery to mix concrete on-site Highly recommended for high-rise and low-rise structures No storage space is needed for materials or machines Quality and consistency are guaranteed Manpower is focused on flatwork and pouring Ample space is needed for delivery trucks Site Mixed Concrete Great for low structures Needs a designated mixing area, which may impact the size of the job site Correct formula must be used to ensure equality mix Needs time to set before it can be poured Involves multiple steps to mix concrete Requires a weigh batch mixer on-site Requires storage space for materials and batch mixers Requires supervision to achieve the desired quality and consistency Needs expertise and effort to prepare and pour Based on the list above, it’s clear that ready-mixed concrete has more advantages over site-mixed concrete. It’s also suitable for most construction projects. Contact Dallas Ready Mix & Concrete Delivery for guaranteed higher quality, consistency, and efficient delivery. What Our Clients Are Saying Mike R.

These differences can influence the choice between Portland and slag cement based on the specific requirements of a construction project. Key Differences: Portland Cement: Commonly used for general construction purposes, including concrete, mortar, and masonry. Slag Cement: Used in specialized applications where enhanced durability and resistance to aggressive chemicals are required. Portland Cement: Typically sets faster and achieves higher early strength. Slag Cement: Often results in higher long-term strength due to the slower hydration process. Portland Cement: Production is energy-intensive and generates significant CO₂ emissions.

Call Today For A Free Estimate 713-682-8337 Request A Call Back Client Testimonials ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mir Z. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Meredith T. My sincere appreciation to the installation team from Impressions in Concrete who worked diligently, as a cohesive team to construct an amazing stamped-concrete courtyard at our home. My wife and I are thrilled with the transformation! Our grateful thanks to Javier and his team on a job well done! - Malcolm C. Had a great experience extending our backyard patio. Communication was good, plenty of colors and patterns to choose from, and the crew was timely and kept the job site clean. Will use them again for future projects! - Erin H. This company is amazing. The team is very professional, they get the job done in the allotted time as promised and you won't be disappointed. I am highly recommending this company for your project. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to write this one. Pictures to follow. - Debbrie L. Impressions in Concrete performed paving work for Fulshear MUD 1 in at a roundabout in the public street right of way. The work was done on time with quality workmanship at the direction of sweitzer+associates, landscape architects - William S. David Smith’s highly skilled craftsmen restored my faded stamped concrete patio to better than new condition. The unique process allowed us to choose a new color combination and the results are fabulous. The craftsmen painstakingly crawled on their hands a knees filling every hole and crack they could find on the 930 sq ft patio. The color mix was “tweaked” to our satisfaction. The final sealer coat was applied without a single bubble. I have seen scores of stamped patios, no one put down a seal coat like this. If David can restore poor work from 15 years ago, his original new construction work will be epic quality. - Jesse M. David and his crew are knowledgeable with stamped concrete. They replaced several sections of my pool deck which is made of stamped concrete. The process consisted of removing several sections of the old deck, as well as removing unconsolidated sand which was being washed out from underneath, causing the old deck to crack and allow water to run underneath. They brought is a sand/clay mix, dug a deeper trench on the outer edge of the deck for a more supportive concrete beam , and then stamped the new sections to match the older adjacent sections of stamped concrete deck. They also removed some of the original wooden expansion joints and topped them with an acrylic sealant. Their work had to be coordinated with another company that I used to replace my leaking skimmers. The entire process went very well and I certainly recommend Impressions in Concrete for any concrete needs. Sincerely Fred - Fred Z. Was a positive experience working with David on resurfacing our walkway and driveway, and getting the right colors and pattern to look good with our brick house. David worked with us on the color scheme and made up one that we requested and had walked us through the various patterns to use at his shop. The crew was very professional on their work, showed up on time and did some slight touch ups we needed at spots by the curb. Could have been a more difficult process with other contractors, and Impressions in Concrete made a smooth process with results we are proud of. - Carter N. I built a new house and was lucky to hire Impressions in Concrete They were on time and did a great job. - E E. This company is amazing. The team is very professional, they get the job done in the allotted time as promised and you won't be disappointed. I am highly recommending this company for your project. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to write this one. Pictures to follow. - Debbrie L. Good quality and professional communication. Would use them again on future projects. - Rory C. We chose Impressions in Concrete for coloring our 20 x 24 feet stamped patio. Visited their showroom twice to review how the colors look in bright sunlight Vs. on your laptop screen. Color combinations can turn out quite different when actually applied to concrete and David patiently helped us select the right ones to match the already constructed cedar pergola. He also sent us sample mixes from other work they were doing. David’s crew did an excellent job of color application, where the pecos sand color highlighted the rose tint in just the right places. We’re very happy with IIC and would gladly recommend their services for all your concrete design, stamping or coloring work. - Bhushan V. The results of our concrete stamped patio exceeded our expectations. David, Javier and the rest of the crew were great to work with. David was quick to respond to my phone calls and questions. His crew was on the jobsite promptly every morning and they were all very professional and courteous. As a homebuilder for 25 years I can tell you that these are qualities that hard to find. We would absolutely recommend them without hesitation. - Mark P Our Past Clients Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Button Check Out Our Recent Projects View More Check Out Our Recent Projects View More Check Out Our Recent Projects View More Location Houston, Texas Call 713-682-8337 Navigation Home About Reviews Our Past Clients Financing Gallery Service Areas Contact Services Residential Concrete Commercial Concrete Decorative Concrete Concrete Pavers Stamped Overlays Patios Pool Decks Patio Covers Firepits Driveways Resealing & Revitalizing Staining & Polishing Epoxy Turf Installation Outdoor Structures Working hours Mon - Fri 9:00 am - 5:00 pm Sat - Sun Closed © 2025 Impressions in Concrete Inc.

The team was very professional and polite. Virginia Atterberry I have used them twice in the past two years. First to extend a patio on the side of my house, which required capping an existing patio, and then recently two small patios in my backyard. They were prompt, courteous, professional, and did very good work. I’m happy to recommend them. Jeanne Garcia Felix and his crew were awesome! I don’t say that lightly!!! From the quote being reasonable to the work being above and beyond and the cleanup I can’t say one bad thing about my experience. Breanna Roiz Super happy with our new driveway. It is still fresh but looking forward to how it will look on 30 days and after we clean it good and do our landscaping around it. Thanks to SATX Concrete contractors. Very punctual and professional.

This type of foundation sits directly on top of the soil and is usually reinforced with steel to prevent cracking. One issue with this type of foundation can be settling or shifting due to changes in moisture levels in the soil. Another type of foundation is beam and pier foundations. They use beams and posts (or piers) to support the weight of a home. These foundations are ideal for areas with soils prone to movement or shifting as they allow for more flexibility and can be adjusted if necessary. However, they may require more maintenance over time than concrete slab foundations. Regardless of the type of foundation your home has, it’s important to regularly inspect it for any signs of damage or shifting. This way, necessary repairs can be made before they become bigger issues. What causes foundation settlement? Soil that’s susceptible to shrinking and swelling can cause foundation issues, as it can create voids beneath the foundation that lead to settling. Poor compaction during construction can also contribute to settling, as it creates weak spots in the soil that can’t support the weight of the structure above. Erosion around the foundation is another factor that can cause settlement. When water flows around a home’s foundation, it erodes the soil away from underneath it causing gaps or spaces between soil layers which leads to settling. What is foundation leveling? Foundation leveling is the process of restoring a home’s foundation to its original level after settling or sinking. It’s a common issue that affects about 25% of homes in the US, and several factors, such as water damage, poor soil conditions, and tree roots, can cause it. If you notice signs of foundation settlement, such as uneven floors or cracks in walls, it’s essential to address the issue promptly to prevent further damage. And remember that foundation leveling isn’t something you should attempt to do yourself since it requires specialized equipment and expertise. What are the signs of foundation problems? If you’re a homeowner, it’s important to keep an eye out for telltale signs that your home may be experiencing foundation issues. One of the most obvious indicators is uneven floors. If you notice that your floors are sloping or sagging in certain areas, this could be a sign of foundation problems. Another red flag is if you see cracks in your walls or ceilings. These cracks can appear both inside and outside of your home. Water damage can also be a sign of foundation issues, so look for water stains on walls or ceilings and dampness or mold growth in basements or crawl spaces. Save your home, time, money, and hassle by calling Xpert Foundation Repair immediately if you see these signs. What is the cost of repairing a slab foundation? The cost of repairing a slab foundation can vary widely depending on several factors, such as the size and type of foundation, the extent of damage, and the method used for repair. Typically, repairing a small crack in a slab foundation may cost around $500 to $1000. However, if your slab foundation has severe cracks caused by water damage resulting from poor drainage around your property, you may need new concrete poured or helical piers installed to stabilize the foundation. The cost could range between $10,000-$15,000 or more. Some small fixes can be as low as $2,000, but it depends on the case. Don’t hesitate to get an accurate estimate from a professional foundation repair contractor who can assess your situation and provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved. How do you choose a foundation repair company? When selecting a foundation contractor, it’s essential to do your research and consider factors such as their experience, reputation, and customer reviews in order to make an informed decision. Hiring qualified foundation contractors is crucial as they offer essential services for addressing foundation problems, including repair and stabilization for both residential and commercial projects. Start by looking for a company that has been in business for several years and has a proven track record of success, like Xpert Foundation Repair in the San Antonio region, with over 20 years in the business. Check their website for information about their experience and the services they offer. You can also ask for references from previous customers or check online review sites like Yelp or Google. Another important factor to consider is the company’s reputation in the community. Look for a company, like Xpert Foundation Repair, that is accredited by professional organizations like the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or National Foundation Repair Association (NFRA). These organizations require members to adhere to strict standards of quality and ethics, ensuring that they work with a reputable company. Finally, read customer reviews carefully to get an idea of how satisfied other homeowners have been with their services. By taking the time to research potential companies thoroughly, you can find one that will provide reliable repairs while giving you peace of mind during what can be a stressful process. What are common signs of foundation problems in San Antonio? In Texas, foundation problems are a common issue due to the state’s expansive clay soils and extreme weather conditions. Here are some common signs of foundation problems in Texas: Cracks in Walls and Floors : One of the most noticeable signs is cracks in interior walls, especially around doors and windows. You might also see cracks in the floors, particularly in tile or concrete flooring. Doors and Windows that Stick : If doors and windows are suddenly difficult to open or close, it could be due to shifting in the foundation, causing frames to become misaligned. Gaps Around Window Frames or Exterior Doors : As the foundation shifts, gaps can develop around windows and doors, which may also result in drafts or moisture intrusion. Uneven or Sloping Floors : A noticeable slope or unevenness in the floors is a strong indicator of foundation problems. You may feel like you’re walking downhill or uphill in certain areas of your home. Separation of Walls from the Ceiling or Floor : If you notice gaps between the walls and the ceiling or floor, it could be a sign that the foundation is settling unevenly. Cracks in the Foundation : Visible cracks in the exterior of the foundation itself are a clear sign of potential issues. These can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Bowing Walls : In more severe cases, the walls of your home may begin to bow or lean, indicating significant foundation movement. Water Pooling Around the Foundation : Poor drainage or water pooling around the base of your home can erode the soil and cause the foundation to shift, leading to problems. Rotating or Leaning Chimney : If the chimney begins to lean away from the house, it’s often due to foundation issues that are causing differential movement. Mold or Moisture in the Crawl Space or Basement : Excess moisture can cause the soil under your foundation to expand and contract, leading to foundation issues. Mold or mildew in these areas is often a sign of this problem.

Kirk communicated well throughout the entire process, and we love our new driveway, patio extension, and shed pad. Trusted, professional, highly recommended. — Trevin W. H&H expanded our patio and also did concrete stamping. They did an excellent job. We had an issue with one section (perhaps a bad batch), and they came back and replaced it, and everything looks better than new. The crews were polite and careful, and we are very pleased with their service. I will recommend them to our HOA and to anyone who asks. Thank you. — Mark S. H&H expanded our patio driveway and added a slab for a shed. They did a fantastic job completing all three projects in a timely manner and were very reasonably priced. Kody (the owner) constantly contacted us throughout the process and followed up after completion to ensure we were satisfied with the job. His crew was careful and diligent with their work.

What is stamped concrete? In providing this service, a rigorous process of pouring concrete on parking lots, driveways, patios, and walkways is followed by the addition of pigment, texture, and patterns before the concrete is fully dry. An upcoming trend in commercial and residential projects, stamped concrete can increase the aesthetics of a place by giving it a look of brick, pavers, or cobblestones. An exciting and beautiful print will emerge from the final product. Why might you want to choose stamped concrete over other options? Depending on how you want to set up your areas and where you leave, original surface materials like brick, pavers, and cobblestone may not give you the best option. For example, if you’ll be remodeling an uneven surface but still want to lay everything in a structured and flat pattern, bricks, pavers and cobblestones will spread out as time goes by. Stamped concrete will give you the structured and flat surface you are aiming to achieve. Stamped concrete gives you a wide array of benefits that some original surface materials may lack. Some of these benefits include: Highly Economical: Affordability is your greatest friend when running on a budget. The lower price range of stamped concrete compared to bricks, tiles, or stone makes it a favorite choice, especially when laid down to cover large areas like walkways, driveways, pool decks, and patios. Stamped concrete gives you a very cost-effective option. Durability: Made of weather-resistant material, stamped concrete is not only economical but also durable. It can handle the extreme weather in Corpus Christi, including hot and cold weather or they rainy season without depreciating in n value for years. Concrete driveways can stay in good shape for 25 to 35 years without any major maintenance work needed. Low Maintenance: With no seams, grouts, or gaps, stamped concrete has a reduced vulnerability to damage. Combined with the ease of cleaning, this material will give you an easy time as far as maintenance is concerned. By simply using a stiff brush and a hose to scrub the surface and applying any basic concrete sealer for another layer of protection, your driveway or other surface can endure rain, sleet, cold temperatures, and ice. Versatile Concrete for any Look: The textures of imprinted concrete can give you a realist appearance of some of the most premium building materials. The creative options provided by stamped concrete make it a popular choice for outdoor pavement materials. With patterns such as wood, slate, tile, stone, brick, and flagstone available, stamped concrete applications will help you achieve any look you want. Concrete stamping remains one of the top low-cost options we provide for Corpus Christi businesses and homeowners alike. Call us to get stamped concrete services that combine the durability and strength of concrete with the natural aesthetics of paving. Our stamped concrete installations are sure to be an investment in elegance. Concrete Driveways High-quality concrete driveways are one of our main specialties for residential and commercial properties in Corpus Christi.

Benefits of a concrete driveway include: Low Maintenance: You will only have to perform occasional cleaning to keep your driveway at its best. Longer Lifetime: You can enjoy a concrete driveway for decades. Compared to asphalt driveways, concrete driveways will last not less than two times longer.

Concrete Foundations & Slabs We are Corpus Christi’s trusted contracts for concrete foundations and slabs. A stable structure must begin with a quality concrete foundation and slab. Why you Need Concrete Foundations and Slabs Damage to the foundation of your residential or commercial building is a major cause of cracked concrete that can develop into devastating damages to the whole structure. Carefully laying foundations and slabs protects you from ever worrying about these quality issues. Our concrete experts are knowledgeable and experienced in cases of foundation damage and have perfected the art of laying concrete foundations and slabs to begin the construction process with a higher standard of artistry. Our foundations and slabs begin and end according to a very definite process, which includes the following steps: Excavation or demolition Proper footings of the area Proper construction of insulated concrete walls Proper laying of slabs Waterproofing and drain tile The outcome of the whole process, starting with excavation, is a job site that is ready for carpenters. With each concrete foundation and slab project, we ensure that your project meets the required accuracy with the greatest efficiency. Concrete Patios We provide you with concrete patio solutions that guarantee value for your money. Design and Finish We focus on getting the design right as the first important step in giving you the patio you desire. The right design is vital for creating not only a functional but attractive outside living area for your home. With the right design, we will help you create a useable and versatile patio you can be proud of for years. Two important questions when creating your patio are: How do you want to use your patio? How much space do you have to work with? After deciding on the size and shape, we will help you make a decision on the type of materials you will need for your concrete patio. Different surface options are in our portfolio, from which you can select one that suits your needs. Surface options for your concrete patio include: Stained concrete Stamped concrete Exposed concrete Colored concrete Engraved concrete Stenciled concrete Benefits of Concrete Patios Most patios traditionally consisted of hard material, such as stone, brick, and concrete before wood decks became stylish a few decades ago. Now, Corpus Christi homeowners are rediscovering the benefits of concrete, including: Durability: The ability of concrete to stand up to a range of weather conditions without staining or fading makes it a popular choice for patios. Low Maintenance: Compared to a wood patio, the concrete option for your patio does not need resealing or staining. Concrete patios also don’t have joints that must be sand-filled unlike paving stones to prevent grass or weeds growing between them. Versatility: The design versatility of stenciling and stamping tools and concrete coloring makes each concrete patio unique. The endless design options for concrete patios make it easy to customize your patio. Environmentally Friendly: You will save lumber and trees by using concrete instead of wood for your patios. You will also not need solvent-based wood stain or sealers with concrete patios, hence increasing their environmental sustainability. Cost-Effective: For a fraction of the cost of other materials, such as paving bricks, concrete patios can be used to produce attractive outcomes. The low maintenance and high durability increases the value of concrete patios. Concrete Pools & Decks Replacement We provide excellent concrete pools and decks services to the entire Corpus Christi area. Our experienced professionals can help you enjoy your pool for years without damages and repairs. Why Call for Concrete Pools and Decks Replacement Services Harsh weather conditions, such as hard freezes, can create cracks on the concrete decking of your pool.

Concrete Restoration Lubbock When concrete repair or resurfacing is no longer enough, concrete restoration is the next best solution. This refers to a process of repairing and renewing concrete structures that have deteriorated over time or are showing damage. Prompt restoration is necessary to ensure safety and to get problems under control while still possible. We’re Lubbock concrete contractors offering comprehensive solutions, to help in various stages of concrete disrepair. Some of the concrete restoration solutions we offer include: Slab Lifting & Leveling We restore concrete surfaces that have either lifted or dropped for a variety of reasons, such as plumbing leaks, tree roots, or poor soil compaction. Sunken or uneven concrete slabs pose serious risks that should be addressed immediately. Our team can restore them to their original level using specialized materials and techniques. Walkway Lifting and Leveling Walkways are designated paths built for safety, accessibility, convenience, and the aesthetics they add to the overall property. However, due to a poorly constructed base, tree roots, soil erosion, and other reasons, walkways can either sink or rise from their intended level. This can result in trip hazards, accessibility concerns, and further damage when left alone. Walkways need to be lifted and leveled to avoid any issues. We’ll get them fixed and restored for you immediately! Expansion Joint Repair Expansion joints play a vital role in preventing cracking and other issues in concrete structures by absorbing the stress that comes with changing temperature and ground movement. Without these flexible parts, structural issues will occur and result in costly repairs. At the first sign of damage, contact your friendly concrete contractor right away. We’ve helped thousands of clients in Lubbock with expert expansion joint repair for both structural and foundational repair. Rebar Spalling Repair Concrete structures and surfaces are reinforced with rebars (steel bars) to increase durability and longevity. Over time, these bars become exposed or corroded, leading to what is known as rebar spalling. Ignoring this problem can lead to more problems. This is where rebar spalling repair comes in. We’ll clear out any weakened material and then apply a concrete mix to match the rest of the structure or surface. Fixing spalling prevents further damage and increases safety and longevity. For any concrete issues, contact us right away. Stamped Concrete We specialize in stamped concrete, also referred to as embossed concrete. Our extensive selection of stamps can mimic a range of designs–pavers, stones, bricks, slates, wood, and more. As one of the leading concrete companies in Lubbock , we’ve stamped hundreds of concrete patios, driveways, pool decks, walkways, and many other projects. So the next time you want your driveway or patio to look like it’s made of natural stone but at a fraction of the cost, contact our pros right away. We’ll customize stamped concrete designs to match your needs and budget. For more on how we can help, visit our other social sites to learn how our concrete services can best serve you.

Poured concrete has been used for various kinds of construction projects, such as roads, sidewalks, bridges, driveways, and parking lots because of its versatility, durability, and longevity. When concrete is poured for a driveway, patio, or garage floor, it’s poured in temporary forms that are removed once the concrete has completely cured and hardened. The quality of the finished product, however, will depend on the contractor. That’s why it’s important to perform your due diligence, so you can better identify which Lubbock concrete companies use quality materials and offer the best workmanship. Whenever you need a top-quality cement slab with the finish you desire, give us a call right away. We guarantee 100% customer satisfaction and free quotes.

Lubbock Concrete FAQs What's the difference between concrete material and cement? Concrete is essentially a blend of aggregates, bound together by cement, serving as the adhesive that holds everything together. Is concrete supposed to crack? It’s completely natural for outdoor concrete to develop cracks during the curing and drying process. That’s why we incorporate control joints, strategically cut into the concrete. These joints serve to guide and manage where any potential cracks may occur. By spacing these joints correctly, we minimize the chance of unsightly random cracks, ensuring a smoother and more visually appealing finish. What areas do you service? We offer concrete services throughout all of Lubbock.

Awesome managers, co-workers, and best of all, my customers… Many I have laughed and joked with, and some I have cried with in their lowest of times. After the hurricane, Zarsky- Kodiak was there for me and my family. I have never had anyone, outside of my family, help me so much! I was deeply touched! You just don’t hear of that nowadays. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts. From Pam Webernick, Victoria location At Zarsky Lumber Port Aransas, we know our customers can go choose to purchase their products from anyone. That’s why we strive to meet their needs and keep them coming back. Our customers are #1 and we are here for them. From Phil Lafara – Port Aransas Zarsky has always treated us like family. Our relationship is more like a partnership than a supplier/ purchaser. They have always been fair and honest and have great employees like Gilbert that support our business needs.
